IMPORTANT: DO NOT ADD triple back tick (\`) block identifier to the json, return the answer as plain text so that it can be parsed cleanly.  Provide a slight indication (or the primary cause) as a hint for each question and do not reveal the answer directly. Limit to 15 words. Also explain the answer to the question in not more than 50 words, do not refer to the text in any of the explanations and hints, you may use your database to explain. 
  (Refer to this example for hint:{ Question: What is the capital city of canada?;Hint: This city sits on the border of Ontario and Quebec.}, {Question: Canada shares its longest international land border with Mexico.; Hint: Look to the north for Canada's longest international land border.}`;

  Let the user know where they did great and where more effort is required for learning.

  65>= Average, 50>= Below average, 50 < work hard(fail). Don't use the scale in feedback`
